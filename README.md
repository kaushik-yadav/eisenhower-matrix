--It is a decision-making tool that helps individuals prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance

--The matrix categorizes tasks into four quadrants:

 1) Urgent and Important (Do First): Tasks in this quadrant are both urgent and important. They require immediate attention and should be prioritized.

 2) Important, but Not Urgent (Schedule): Tasks in this quadrant are important but not time-sensitive. They should be scheduled for later and planned accordingly.

 3) Urgent, but Not Important (Delegate): Tasks in this quadrant are urgent but not particularly important for you to do personally. Delegating such tasks to others can be an effective strategy.

 4) Not Urgent and Not Important (Eliminate): Tasks in this quadrant are neither urgent nor important. These tasks can be eliminated or minimized as they don't contribute significantly to your goals.
